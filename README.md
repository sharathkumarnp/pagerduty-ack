# pagerduty-ack
Script to ack an incident

This script only provides the way to acknowledge a incident by providing its incident_id.
If you want to automate this process 

To automatically acknowledge new incidents in PagerDuty when triggered, you can use PagerDuty Event Rules and an integration such as a webhook or automation tool to invoke the acknowledgement API. Here's a general outline of the process:

Set up an Event Rule in PagerDuty:

Go to the PagerDuty web interface and navigate to the "Configuration" tab.
Select "Event Rules" and click on "New Event Rule" or "Add Event Rule".
Configure the conditions for the rule based on the event properties (e.g., incident type, service, etc.).
Set the action to trigger a webhook or invoke an automation tool when the rule matches.
Implement an automation tool or webhook:

If using a webhook, set up a server or service that listens for incoming webhook requests.
If using an automation tool like Zapier or Integromat, create a new automation flow with the appropriate trigger and action.
Configure the automation tool or webhook:

Provide the webhook URL or automation flow details in the PagerDuty Event Rule.
Configure the webhook payload or automation flow to invoke the PagerDuty API and acknowledge the incident.
Use the PagerDuty REST API and provide the necessary incident ID and authentication headers to acknowledge the incident.
By setting up the Event Rule in PagerDuty and integrating it with an automation tool or webhook, you can automatically trigger the acknowledgment process whenever a new incident matches the defined conditions. The automation tool or webhook will then invoke the PagerDuty API to acknowledge the incident on your behalf.

Please note that the specific implementation details may vary based on the automation tool or webhook service you choose. Consult the documentation or support resources of your chosen integration for more detailed instructions on configuring webhooks or automation flows.
